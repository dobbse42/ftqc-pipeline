Many different schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computing exist, utilizing many different QEC codes, often with drastically different characteristics, as well as many different methods of initializing encoded logical states, performing syndrome extraction, performing decoding, applying fault-tolerant gates, and applying corrections to qubits. These schemes are also intended for different quantum computing hardware paradigms, often with different connectivity constraints (even within the same paradigm), native gatesets, and optimization targets.
